    <h2 class="my-4">About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a software developer with a passion for creating beautiful, intuitive, and user-friendly applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        From IS413, I am hoping to gain experience with ASP.NET and Razor/Blazor, as well as learn more about the MVC framework. I want to gain further familiarity with the C# language, and I would love to learn React. I use ASP.NET at work to build our API, however it is a massive, complex application, so I feel that nailing down concepts in a less contextual environment will help me learn the governing principles better.
